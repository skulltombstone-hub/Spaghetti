/**
 * Flat JNI surface — direct mirror of [src/web/main.c]'s shape. Each function does one thing and
 * returns; the loop, the lifecycle, the dedicated render thread, and EGL all live in
 * [ButterscotchDroidRunner] on the JVM side.
 *
 * Threading contract: every render-side function ([startRunner], [runOneFrame], [stopRunner])
 * MUST be called from the same OS thread that owns the EGL context (the one [ButterscotchEGL]
 * was bound on). [ButterscotchDroidRunner] is the only thing that should call these. The exception
 * is [onKey], which is safe to call from any thread (its events are queued under a mutex on the C
 * side and drained inside `runOneFrame`).
 *
 * Native -> Kotlin push notifications ([onTitleChanged], [onGameSizeChanged]) come in via
 * @JvmStatic methods that the C side invokes through cached jmethodIDs. They fire from the render
 * thread; Compose's snapshot system handles the cross-thread state write safely.
