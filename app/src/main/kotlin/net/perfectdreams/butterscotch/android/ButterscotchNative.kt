/**
 * Flat JNI surface — direct mirror of [src/web/main.c]'s shape. Each function does one thing and
 * returns; the loop, the lifecycle, EGL, frame pacing, and the input queue all live in
 * [ButterscotchDroidRunner] / this object on the JVM side.
 *
 * Threading contract: the render-side externals ([startRunner], [beginFrame], [onKeyDown],
 * [onKeyUp], [stepAndDraw], [stopRunner]) MUST be called from the same OS thread that owns the
 * EGL context (the one [ButterscotchEgl] was bound on). [ButterscotchDroidRunner] is the only
 * thing that should call these.
 *
 * The exception is [onKey], which is safe to call from any thread — it does no JNI work itself,
 * just pushes into a [Channel] that the render thread drains on each frame.
 *
 * Native -> Kotlin push notifications ([onTitleChanged], [onGameSizeChanged]) come in via
 * @JvmStatic methods that the C side invokes through cached jmethodIDs. They fire from the render
 * thread; Compose's snapshot system handles the cross-thread state write safely.
